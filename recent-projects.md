          <h3>design + development</h3>
          <p>Students, faculty, and journalists travelled to China, Peru and West Africa—key locations in the global fishmeal industry—to investigate its true costs.

            <h2>Back & Forth</h2>
            <h3>Management + Writing + Design</h3>
            <p>An open-source platform to deliver team-based, real-world interactive experiences. I managed this project from its inception, raised funds, and built partnerships with organizations like the City of Vancouver and the Stanley Park Ecology Society. I also lead writing and gameplay design for its first use case: a satirical, team-based apocalypse training game called <em>Apocalypse Made Easy!</em> designed to teach people about emergency preparedness.

            <h2>Global Reporting Centre</h2>
            <h3>Design + Development + Writing</h3>
            <p>The Global Reporting Centre is a non-profit media organization based at the University of British Columbia. I designed and developed a WordPress theme in consultation with staff and the advisory board, including customizations to the admin interface to make updating and publishing to the site easier.

            <h2>Okanagan College</h2>
            <h3>Writing + Development</h3>
            <p>I helped plan the redevelopment of Okanagan College's website, which included producing a detailed environmental scan and report, assisting with stakeholder coordination and in-person feedback sessions, and creating a custom web-based testing tool. The tool incorporated timed randomized tasks for users to perform as well as A/B testing.</p>
